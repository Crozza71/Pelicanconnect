Educational Database

# ***Pelicanconnect***. 

The brief to build a database on members associated with one or many schools.
The fields requested being "Name", "Email address" and "School". Secondly I should display all members for a selected School.

How it works?
On opening the website, the full list of members is displayed.
There is a form button that allows  you to enter a new member with an email address and pick from a list of schools.
If you would like to see who else is a member from a specific school you are able to click on the schools dropdown menu and pick a school which will give you all the members.
On refreshing the page again you will be taken back to the full database, or alternatively, clicking on another school would give you that schools members.

I have used Javascript and jQuery for simplicity and understanding of the project. 
I also used a Bootstrap template to build the dropdown menu.
I used Node.js as a server and ran Mongoose with it for my back end. On the front end I used Python as a server for development properties.

In CSS I have tiled the individual cards for ease of reading.

If I were to have more time I would try to build this in Angular to be used as a single page website instead of having to continually refresh the page.

I would also have portfolio pictures and an about page about the Schools and possibly a profile picture of the individual.
